# 🏦 FinTrust Bank India – Digital Banking Transformation

## 📌 Project Summary
This repository holds the **end-to-end Business Analysis documentation** for FinTrust Bank’s digital transformation initiative — moving from traditional branch-based banking to a **customer-friendly online banking solution**.

This project showcases a full BA lifecycle: from identifying current pain points to defining business and functional requirements, creating user stories, UI mockups, and process flows.

## ❗ Current Challenges
FinTrust Bank currently operates only via physical branches. Customers must visit the branch for:

- Account registration  
- Balance checks  
- Fund transfers  
- Accessing transaction records  

This results in:
- Long queues and delays  
- High operational costs  
- Limited service availability  
- Decreased customer satisfaction  
- Risk of customers migrating to digital-first competitors  

---

## 💡 Strategic Solution
To address these challenges, the bank is launching a **secure, responsive online banking platform** that enables:

- 24/7 account access  
- Self-service onboarding and profile management  
- Fund transfers and transaction monitoring  
- Access to digital statements  
- Integration with core banking and authentication systems  

This will significantly reduce in-branch traffic, operational workload, and enhance user experience.
