# 🏦 FinTrust Bank India – Digital Banking Transformation

## 📌 Project Summary
This repository contains the **end-to-end Business Analysis documentation** for FinTrust Bank’s digital transformation initiative — moving from traditional branch-based banking to a **user-centric online banking solution**.

The project highlights the complete BA lifecycle: identifying business problems, defining requirements, documenting user stories, designing wireframes, and visualizing process flows.

## ❗ Current Challenges
FinTrust Bank currently offers only **in-branch services**. Customers are required to visit the branch for:

- New account registration  
- Checking balances  
- Fund transfers  
- Accessing transaction history  

This leads to:
- Long wait times and slower services  
- High manual workload and operational costs  
- Limited service hours  
- Decreased customer satisfaction  
- Increased risk of losing customers to digital-native banks  

---

## 💡 Strategic Solution
To resolve these pain points, FinTrust Bank is launching a **secure, responsive online banking portal** that will:

- Allow 24/7 digital access to banking services  
- Enable self-service account management  
- Facilitate fund transfers and statement downloads  
- Seamlessly integrate with the bank’s existing core and authentication systems  

This will streamline operations and significantly enhance customer experience.
